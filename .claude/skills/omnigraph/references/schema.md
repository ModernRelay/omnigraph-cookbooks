How to write and evolve `.pg` schemas in Omnigraph.

## Authoring (.pg files)

### Use `//` for comments

Not `#`. The compiler rejects `#` with a parse error that looks like:

```
parse error: expected schema_file
```

### Enums are inline, not standalone

The compiler does **not** accept top-level `enum Foo { ... }` blocks. Put the values inline on the property:

```pg
kind: enum(product, technology, framework, concept, ops) @index
```

If the same enum appears on multiple nodes, duplicate it inline — there's no shared enum type.

### Lists contain scalars only

`[String]` and `[I32]` are fine. `[Category]` (a list of enum values) is **not** supported. Use `[String]` with query-side filtering, or use a single-valued enum property if one value is enough.

### `@embed` takes a source and optional model

```pg
embedding: Vector(1536) @embed("text", model="openai/text-embedding-3-large") @index
```

The identifier form `@embed(text)` is also valid. The quoted form is canonical;
omit `model=...` when the embedding provider supplies the model.

The annotation does not generate vectors on mutation or load. Supply a required
target explicitly; nullable targets may remain null. See [`search.md`](search.md).

### System identity is separate from user properties

Use `@id`, `@src`, and `@dst` for system fields in queries. Edge constraints may
name `@src`/`@dst`; no constraint may name `@id` (identity is already the row
key). Name rules depend on the graph's vintage:

- **New graphs** store system fields as `__id`, `__src`, and `__dst`,
  and may declare ordinary properties named `id`, `src`, or `dst`. Every
  property name beginning `_` is reserved.
- **Legacy graphs** (spellings kept by `omnigraph upgrade`) retain physical
  `id`/`src`/`dst` and refuse `id` on any type, `src`/`dst` on edges, and
  `__id`/`__src`/`__dst`. Other `_` names are still accepted there, but they
  block `schema upgrade-system-columns`.
- **All vintages:** `from` and `to` are reserved edge property names (insert
  endpoints), and `_distance`/`_score` are refused as property names.

Inspect `system_columns` in `schema show --json` rather than inferring the
graph vintage from the binary. Writing bare `src` in an edge constraint on a
new graph fails at `init`/`schema plan` (offline `lint` does not catch it) with
`unknown property reference 'Knows.src'; the system field is '@src'`; respell
local `.pg` files after `schema upgrade-system-columns`.

### Edge constraints go inside a body block

`@unique(@src, @dst)` on an edge goes inside `{ }`, after `@card(...)`:

```pg
edge PartOfArtifact: Chunk -> InformationArtifact @card(1..1) {
    @unique(@src)
}
```

An edge may declare `@key(@src, @dst)` (plus additional non-null scalar
properties) to derive identity from that tuple. Both endpoints are required
key members. Declare it when creating the type: adding, removing, or changing
a key on an existing edge type is refused by the planner. Repeated inserts of
the same key upsert the edge; without a key, repeated endpoint pairs remain
distinct edges. The derived id orders `@src`, `@dst`, then scalar members in
catalog order (not declaration order), so omit `id` rather than building it by
hand. Edges cannot be `update`d (`T16`): re-insert a keyed edge to change its
non-key properties. The property-level `@key` shorthand is refused on edge
properties.

### Lint after every edit

```bash
omnigraph lint --schema schema.pg --query queries/signals.gq
```

This validates the schema **and** the queries against it. No running repo required. Wire it into a precommit hook.

## Evolution (schema plan/apply)

### Plan before apply

```bash
omnigraph schema plan --schema next.pg s3://bucket/repo --json
# inspect "supported": true|false and the step list
omnigraph schema apply --schema next.pg s3://bucket/repo
```

If `supported: false`, fix the source before applying. Plan is free; run it as often as needed.

Plan/apply diagnostics may carry stable codes of the form **`OG-XXX-NNN`**. When
a code is present, match it rather than the free-form message text.

**Drops reclaim nothing at apply.** Dropping a property or type removes it from
the current schema; older commits still read the dropped data until
`omnigraph cleanup` stops retaining them, and only then is it gone for good. No
flag makes a drop destructive at apply: to reclaim the space, run `cleanup`
with a retention that excludes the commits before the drop. A served graph
evolves through `cluster plan --server …` and `cluster apply --server …`;
there is no graph schema-apply HTTP endpoint.

### Apply is main-only

`omnigraph schema apply` rejects any non-`main` branches. Delete feature branches first (`branch merge … --delete-branch` or `branch delete`); a merge alone leaves the branch live. This is deliberate: schema changes don't go through review branches. They go straight to main via `plan` + `apply`.

### Rename, don't replace

Use `@rename_from(...)` on renames so the planner emits a rename step (preserves data), not a drop+add pair (loses data):

```pg
node Account @rename_from("User") {
    full_name: String @rename_from("name")
}
```

Works on node types, edge types, and properties.

### Required properties need a backfill plan

Adding a non-nullable property to an existing node or edge type is rejected as
unsupported. Pattern:

1. Add as optional: `new_prop: String?`
2. Apply
3. Backfill via a `mutate` or `load --mode merge`
4. Keep it optional: tightening `T?` -> `T` is currently refused by the planner
   (a property-type change, OG-MF-106). Enforce presence at write time by
   convention, or rebuild with the stricter schema when required.

### Enum widening is a supported apply

Adding variants to an `enum(...)` property is a metadata-only migration step:
`schema plan` shows `extend enum ...`, `apply` touches no table data, and new
variants are accepted immediately on every write surface. Narrowing, renaming
a variant, or converting enum <-> `String` still refuse (OG-MF-106) — those
remain rebuild territory. Value *order* never matters (values are normalized).

### Keep `@key` stable

Changing the key field is effectively a replace — it invalidates every external reference to the node. `schema plan` refuses adding, removing, or changing `@key` on an existing node or edge type; an identity change is an export/rebuild migration, not a casual field rename.

### Constraints: only `@index` is added in place

Adding a constraint other than `@index` (`@key`, `@unique`, `@range`, `@check`)
to an existing type, removing any constraint, and changing edge cardinality or
endpoints are refused as unsupported. In-place migrations are additions of
nullable properties and types, `@index` additions, enum widening, renames, and
drops; tightening a constraint means a rebuild.

### Availability during apply

Standalone schema apply serializes with writes. Served cluster apply closes
affected graph admission and drains admitted work before changing its schema;
new requests to that graph can receive `503 graph_unavailable` during the
transition. Unrelated ready graphs keep serving.

## Supported Types

- **Scalars:** `String`, `Bool`, `I32`, `I64`, `U32`, `U64`, `F32`, `F64`, `Date`, `DateTime`, `Blob`
- **Collections:** `Vector(N)` (fixed-size float vector), `[ScalarType]` (list of scalar)
- **Enums:** `enum(value1, value2, ...)` — inline only, values can contain alphanumerics, underscores, hyphens
- **Optional:** any type + `?` suffix (`String?`, `[I32]?`, `Vector(4)?`)

## Decorators (quick reference)

**Property-level shorthand:**
- `@key` — single-property node key
- `@unique` — single-property uniqueness constraint
- `@index` — single-property index intent (currently materialized automatically only for node properties)
- `@embed("source_prop")` — associates a node Vector property with a String source; does not populate it during writes
- `@description("...")` — metadata (no migration impact)

**Edge-level:**
- `@card(min..max)` — edge cardinality (default: unbounded from zero; write an open upper bound as `@card(1..)`)

**Type-level (nodes/edges):**
- `@instruction("...")` — semantic hint for LLMs/operators

**Rename (nodes/edges/properties):**
- `@rename_from("OldName")` — migration-aware rename

**Group-level (inside body block):**
- `@key(prop1, prop2)` — ordered node identity tuple
- `@key(@src, @dst, prop)` — edge identity tuple including both endpoints and optional scalar members
- `@unique(prop1, prop2)` — composite uniqueness, enforced as a true tuple key at intake and merge (works on edges too: `@unique(@src, @dst)`). Members must reduce to scalar keys. Blob is rejected at schema admission; list/vector declarations may parse but writes fail scalar-key validation.
- `@index(prop1, prop2)` — composite index intent. Composite and edge intents are accepted but are not currently materialized as property indexes.
- `@range(prop, min..max)` — node-only numeric bounds; either bound may be omitted
- `@check(prop, "regex")` — node-only String regular-expression constraint

## Interfaces

Declare a shared property contract and have node types implement it:

```pg
interface Searchable {
    title: String @index
    embedding: Vector(3072) @embed("title")
}

node Doc implements Searchable {
    slug: String @key
    body: String
}
```

## Design Principles (brief)

- **Identity is explicit** — use `@key` on a semantic slug, not internal row IDs
- **Narrow types** — `Date` over `String` for dates, `enum` over `String` for lifecycle states
- **Edge semantics matter** — prefer `AuthoredBy` over `RelatedTo`
- **Constraints live in the schema** — `@unique`, `@range`, `@card` keep invariants out of application code
- **Schemas are reviewable** — clear names, explicit enums, obvious keys

## Schema Evolution in Cluster Mode

In a cluster deployment there is **no direct `omnigraph schema apply`** — the
schema is declared (`graphs.<id>.schema:` in `cluster.yaml`) and converged:

```bash
$EDITOR schema.pg
omnigraph cluster plan --server <name|url> --config . --json
omnigraph cluster apply --server <name|url> --config .
# the running server publishes and activates the new shape; no restart
```

Without `--server`, `cluster apply --config . --as <you>` writes the storage
root itself: stop the server and transfer its cluster lock first (see
[`cluster.md`](cluster.md)), then start the server to serve the new shape.

Differences from direct `schema apply` (on a non-cluster store): out-of-band
schema changes on the live graph are *drift* — the next `cluster apply`
refuses with `applied_schema_drift`. There is no correction/adoption flag that
bypasses this check; investigate the mismatched graph authority.
Everything else in this file (`@rename_from`, backfills,
linting, enum discipline) applies unchanged to the `.pg` you edit.
