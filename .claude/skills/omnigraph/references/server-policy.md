# HTTP Server and Cedar Policy

Use this reference for a cluster-served graph. The server is cluster-only; CLI
commands can instead open graph storage directly when their help permits it.

## Start a server

```bash
export OMNIGRAPH_SERVER_BEARER_TOKENS_JSON='{"act-alice":"replace-with-a-secret"}'
omnigraph-server --cluster ./company-brain --bind 127.0.0.1:8080
omnigraph-server --cluster s3://bucket/prefix --bind 0.0.0.0:8080
```

The server loads the cluster's applied revision and serves each graph under
`/graphs/{id}`. `cluster apply --server` activates schema, stored-query, policy,
provider and external-Blob changes, plus graph creation/deletion, without a
restart. Direct apply requires serving to be stopped. There is no single-graph server mode. A stopped server, even
after a clean exit, leaves the cluster lock: once its writes have settled,
clear it with `cluster force-unlock <LOCK_ID>` before the next start (see
[cluster mode](cluster.md)).

Shutdown is bounded by `--shutdown-grace-seconds` (else
`OMNIGRAPH_SHUTDOWN_GRACE_SECONDS`, default 25; `0` cuts off immediately). At
SIGTERM readiness turns off and in-flight requests drain; a clean drain exits
0 and reaching the deadline exits 2. Give the orchestrator a longer
termination grace. Check rollout readiness with `GET /readyz`, not `/healthz`.

## Route families

| Route family | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `GET /healthz`, `/openapi.json` | Process metadata |
| `GET /readyz` | Replica readiness, applied revision and served/ready/loading/blocked counts |
| `GET /graphs` | List graphs with their availability (`graph_list`) |
| `POST /cluster/plan` | Preview the submitted configuration without effects (`config_manage`) |
| `POST /cluster/deployments`, `GET /cluster/deployments[/{id}]` | Submit once and inspect a deployment; exact-ID observation survives caller disconnect |
| `/graphs/{id}/query`, `/mutate` | Inline GQ reads and writes |
| `/graphs/{id}/mutate/if-graph-commit` | Conditional inline mutation (header `Omnigraph-If-Graph-Commit`) |
| `/graphs/{id}/queries` | List/invoke stored queries; `/queries/{name}/if-graph-commit` for conditional writes |
| `/graphs/{id}/load`, `/load/ndjson` | Bounded atomic loads |
| `/graphs/{id}/blob` | GET/HEAD one Blob cell |
| `/graphs/{id}/branches` | Branch operations and merge |
| `/graphs/{id}/snapshot`, `/commits` | Snapshot and history |
| `/graphs/{id}/commits/{commit}/changes` | One first-parent commit diff |
| `GET /graphs/{id}/changes`, `POST /graphs/{id}/changes/baseline` | Poll a feed or capture a baseline |
| `/graphs/{id}/schema` | Read the accepted schema |
| `/graphs/{id}/export` | Stream a branch snapshot |

Every request to a graph, registry or deployment route must carry exactly one
`Omnigraph-Http-Api: 0.13` header; a missing, repeated or other value is
refused with `400 api_contract_mismatch` before graph access. Responses carry
the same header. `/healthz`, `/readyz` and `/openapi.json` need none. Upgrade
the CLI, server and HTTP clients together.

Graph schema changes use cluster plan/apply. There is no graph schema-apply
endpoint and no alias routes for older HTTP contracts. Discover the contract
with `/healthz` before sending protected requests; redirects and mismatched
responses are not permission to replay an effectful request.

Canonical `/query` JSON includes the graph commit pinned with its rows when the
read snapshot has an effective graph head; a fresh pre-commit graph can omit it. Exact
write receipts and conditional semantics are summarized in
[commit changes and feeds](changes.md). Blob delivery is in [Blob values](blobs.md).

Canonical `/query` accepts `branch list`; `/mutate` accepts `branch create`,
`branch delete` and `branch merge` with no request target, name or params. These
return branch outcomes, not ordinary data-mutation receipts; see
[branch statements](changes.md#branch-statements). `/schema` reports the graph's
physical `system_columns`; GQ uses `@id`/`@src`/`@dst` on either storage vintage.

`/readyz` is unauthenticated and contains no graph names. It identifies the
booted applied revision, reports `ready: false`/HTTP 503 while
a graph is loading, when a nonempty inventory has no ready graph, and while
draining, and includes `served_graph_count`, `ready_graph_count`,
`loading_graph_count` and `blocked_graph_count`. Authorized `GET /graphs`
returns one `graphs` list with each graph's `state`, availability, `action`
and, when blocked, `failure`; an authorized request to a blocked graph answers
`503 graph_unavailable`, not `404`. Healthy graphs keep serving unless startup
uses `--require-all-graphs`; an applied empty cluster can be ready, while a
nonempty cluster with every graph failed refuses startup. A readiness request
never activates a revision.

## Authentication and actor identity

Bearer tokens map actors at the server boundary. Request headers and bodies
cannot choose another actor. Configure token sources on the server process;
clients can store a named server token with:

```bash
echo "$TOKEN" | omnigraph login production
omnigraph query get_person --server production --graph knowledge
```

A server with no credential source (static tokens or signed-token trust) and no
policy refuses to start unless explicitly
given `--unauthenticated` (or `OMNIGRAPH_UNAUTHENTICATED=1`). Use that only on a
trusted development network. Tokens without a policy allow only `read`; other
actions remain denied.

Managed signed data credentials are a separate token source, enabled with
`--data-token-trust <file>`. The trust file binds keys to the exact deployment;
tokens select an immutable principal actor. An identity credential carries no
permissions; only version-2 identity credentials are accepted.
That actor (`principal:<immutable-id>`) must itself be permitted by the applied
Cedar policy, or every graph request is denied; an identity credential can
still list graph ids through `GET /graphs/discovery`. Trust changes need a
restart.
Control-plane login does not grant data access. See
[managed data credentials](https://github.com/ModernRelay/omnigraph/blob/main/docs/user/cli/managed-data.md).

## Cedar actions

Graph-scoped actions are:

| Action | Covers |
|---|---|
| `read` | Queries, snapshots, branches, commits, Blob reads, and change polling |
| `export` | Export and change-feed baseline capture |
| `change` | Mutations and loads |
| `schema_apply` | Served schema changes and graph deletion: required on each affected existing graph |
| `branch_create`, `branch_delete`, `branch_merge` | Corresponding branch operation |
| `invoke_query` | Entry to a stored query |
| `admin` | Reserved; no current public operation |

`graph_list` is cluster-scoped and controls `GET /graphs`. `config_manage` is
cluster-scoped too and authorizes served cluster planning and deployment; put
it in a rule of its own. Current policy authorizes configuration changes; a
proposed policy cannot authorize its own installation. A stored read needs
`invoke_query` plus `read`; a stored mutation needs `invoke_query` plus
`change`. A denied and unknown stored-query name both appear as `404` to a
caller lacking `invoke_query`. A load with `from` also needs `branch_create`
for the fork, and a merge with `delete_branch` needs `branch_delete` for the
cleanup step (a denied deletion leaves the merge successful).

## Declare and test policy

Bind one bundle to graph ids and another, if needed, to the cluster scope:

```yaml
# cluster.yaml
policies:
  graph-access:
    file: graph.policy.yaml
    applies_to: [knowledge]
  server-access:
    file: server.policy.yaml
    applies_to: [cluster]
```

Policies are allow-only; omit a grant to deny it:

```yaml
version: 1
groups:
  readers: [act-alice, act-bob]
rules:
  - id: readers-can-read
    allow:
      actors: { group: readers }
      actions: [read]
      branch_scope: any
  - id: readers-can-invoke
    allow:
      actors: { group: readers }
      actions: [invoke_query]
```

`branch_scope` is valid only with `read`, `export`, and `change`;
`target_branch_scope` only with `branch_create`, `branch_delete`,
`branch_merge`, and `schema_apply`. Any other pairing, or both scopes on one
rule, is refused. Values are `any`, `protected`, or `unprotected`, where
protected branches are the bundle's top-level `protected_branches: [main, …]`
list. `invoke_query`, `graph_list` and `config_manage` take no branch scope.

```bash
omnigraph policy validate --cluster . --graph knowledge
omnigraph policy test --cluster . --graph knowledge --tests policy.tests.yaml
omnigraph policy explain --cluster . --graph knowledge \
  --actor act-alice --action read --branch main
```

The `policy` commands evaluate applied bundles, not draft files. Validate the
source with `cluster validate`, preview with `cluster plan --server …`, then
apply. Live policy changes drain admitted work before later requests use the
new HTTP and engine permissions. Process token sources and signed-token trust
remain startup settings.

The CLI policy selector currently requires exactly one matching bundle. With
both a graph bundle and a `cluster` bundle applied, `--graph <id>` refuses with
"matches 2 policy bundles"; this inspection limitation does not prevent the
server from applying or enforcing those bundles.

## Direct access is a separate trust boundary

Served requests always use the server's policy engine. Embedded engine hosts
can also install a policy engine, and every mutating engine entry point then
enforces it.

The standalone CLI opening `--store` or a positional URI does **not** load the
cluster server's Cedar bundle. Its `--as` value records actor attribution but
does not recreate server authorization. Protect raw graph storage with object
store IAM/ACLs and restrict who can run direct maintenance. Served writes reject
client-supplied actor identity because only the token may select it.

Canonical contracts: [server operations](https://github.com/ModernRelay/omnigraph/blob/main/docs/user/operations/server.md)
and [authorization](https://github.com/ModernRelay/omnigraph/blob/main/docs/user/operations/policy.md).
