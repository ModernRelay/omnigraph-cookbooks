# Stored-Query Registries

A **stored query** is a `.gq` query that the *server* loads, type-checks at startup, and exposes by name — without ever accepting ad-hoc query source from the client. It's how you publish a vetted, typed query surface to remote callers and MCP tools.

It is distinct from CLI `aliases:` (see [`aliases.md`](aliases.md)): an alias
is local client ergonomics; a stored query is a server-published,
policy-gated endpoint.

## Declaring stored queries (`cluster.yaml`)

Stored queries are declared in the cluster's `cluster.yaml` — every `query <name>` in the listed `.gq` files registers:

```yaml
graphs:
  <id>:
    schema: schema.pg
    queries: queries/            # discover every `query <name>` in queries/*.gq
```

`queries` also accepts an explicit file list (`[a.gq, b.gq]`) or a fine-grained `name: { file: … }` map; an unparseable `.gq` or a duplicate query name across files fails `cluster validate`. `cluster apply` publishes them to the content-addressed catalog, and the `--cluster` server type-checks and serves every applied query. Every applied query is listed.

A standalone `branch create`, `branch delete`, `branch merge`, or `branch list`
statement cannot be registered as a stored query. Registry files must contain
named `query` declarations; `lint`, `cluster validate`, and server registry
loading reject branch-statement files.

## CLI

```bash
omnigraph queries validate --cluster .             # all applied graphs
omnigraph queries validate --cluster . --graph dev # one graph
omnigraph queries list --cluster . --graph dev     # names and typed params
```

- `cluster validate --config .` checks desired `.gq` sources before apply.
  `queries validate` instead audits the **applied** registry against each
  applied schema without restarting the server; it cannot see unapplied source
  edits. Registry drift or duplicate names quarantine the affected graph by
  default while healthy graphs serve; startup is fatal when no healthy graph
  remains or `--require-all-graphs` is set.
- Both commands take `--cluster <dir|uri>`; `--graph` narrows the operation to
  one declared graph.
- `queries` is distinct from `lint` — `lint` validates a single `.gq` file you point it at; `queries validate` validates the registry the server will actually serve.

## HTTP surface

| Route | Gate | Purpose |
|-------|------|---------|
| `GET /graphs/{id}/queries` | `read` | Typed tool catalog of the served queries. Graph-wide (branch-independent; `read` authorized against `main`). |
| `POST /graphs/{id}/queries/{name}` | `invoke_query` (+ `change` for a stored mutation) | Invoke a named query. Body carries params only — **never** `.gq` source. A stored mutation cannot target a `snapshot` (`400`); a param type error is a structured `400` naming the param. |

`?branch=` / `?snapshot=` query params apply to `POST /graphs/{id}/queries/{name}` reads; branch/snapshot access stays enforced by the inner `read`/`change` gate (`invoke_query` itself is graph-scoped, not branch-scoped).

Stored reads share the [query result contract](queries.md#system-fields-and-result-values):
system identities use `@id`, bare node projections return objects, null fields
are omitted from JSON rows, and DateTime strings are UTC without a trailing
`Z`. Check consumer expectations when upgrading the stored-query surface.

## Policy gating (`invoke_query`)

- **`invoke_query`** is a per-graph Cedar action gating the whole stored-query invocation surface. Grant it like any other action (see [`server-policy.md`](server-policy.md)).
- **Stored mutations are double-gated:** the caller needs `invoke_query` to reach the query **and** `change` for the write. An actor with `invoke_query` but not `change` gets `403` on a stored mutation.
- **Deny == unknown:** for a caller *lacking* `invoke_query`, a denial and an unknown query name return the **same 404** (identical body) — the catalog can't be probed. A caller who *holds* `invoke_query` may still get a `403` from the inner gate for a query it can't `read`/`change`, so existence is visible to grant-holders by design.
- **Default-deny mode** (bearer tokens, no policy bundle) permits only `read`,
  so every `/graphs/{id}/queries/{name}` call returns `404` until an
  `invoke_query` rule is configured.

## MCP exposure

Every applied query is listed in `GET /graphs/{id}/queries` as a typed MCP tool.
There is no per-query `mcp:` flag in cluster mode.

## Note on per-query authorization

The catalog is not Cedar-filtered per query: a caller with `read` but not
`invoke_query` can list a query it cannot invoke (invocation would 404).
The catalog is a discovery surface and `invoke_query` is the invocation gate.
